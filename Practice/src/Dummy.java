Given an array of integers and a number K. Find the count of distinct elements in every window of size K in the array.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 7, K = 4
A[] = {1,2,1,3,4,2,3}
Output: 3 4 4 3
Explanation: Window 1 of size k = 4 is
1 2 1 3. Number of distinct elements in
this window are 3. 
Window 2 of size k = 4 is 2 1 3 4. Number
of distinct elements in this window are 4.
Window 3 of size k = 4 is 1 3 4 2. Number
of distinct elements in this window are 4.
Window 4 of size k = 4 is 3 4 2 3. Number

You are given a pointer/ reference to the node which is to be deleted from the linked list of N nodes. The task is to delete the node. Pointer/ reference to head node is not given. 
Note: No head reference is given to you. It is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is not a tail node in the linked list.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 2
value[] = {1,2}
node = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: After deleting 1 from the
linked list, we have remaining nodes
as 2.
N = 4
value[] = {10,20,4,30}
node = 20
Output: 10 4 30
Explanation: After deleting 20 from
the linked list, we have remaining
nodes as 10, 4 and 30.

Given a binary tree, find if it is height balanced or not. 
A tree is height balanced if difference between heights of left and right subtrees is not more than one for all nodes of tree. 

A height balanced tree
        1
     /     \
   10      39
  /
5

An unbalanced tree
        1
     /    
   10   
  /
5

Example 1:

Input:
      1
    /
   2
    \
     3 
Output: 0
Explanation: The max difference in height
of left subtree and right subtree is 2,
which is greater than 1. Hence unbalanced
